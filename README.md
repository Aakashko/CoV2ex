The ongoing pandemic had a lot of impacts on human life. Due to the lockdown in the entire country, people are having more time these days and hence are into social media. Social media has become a platform wherein people share all their thoughts and emotions. Due to the social distancing norms and other preventive measures, people are connecting each other through this platform. This gives us the opportunity to analyse the overall mental reaction of the people to this pandemic. In this paper, we collected data from twitter having state wise tweets related to COVID-19 pandemic and have manually set the emotion conveyed by each tweet in it. This is then used for training the model and we output the average emotion conveyed by each state. This can be useful in understanding the psychological impact the COVID-19 had on the people, state-wise; helping the governments to take necessary actions accordingly. The output as well as COVID-19 guidelines and data are then represented in a website.
